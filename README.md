Let me know if you like the way I work. Our goal is to give doctors the tools to create intelligent and smart medical questionnaires for free, for their patients. The questionnaires pump data, those data are processed and presented to the doctor in the format he knows from medical school. That way, the doctor is able to save a lot of time, yet has all information about medical history and context, and about the current complaints. The doctors will be able focus on the issues at hand.

Keep me posted about your projects. Hans
